## 0.3.5

Changes to the Rust Engine:
 - The module `names` now produces `ExplicitDefId`s instead of `DefId`s (#1648)
 - Add a resugaring `FunctionsToConstants` (#1559)
 - Drop the tuple nodes of the AST, add resugaring node for tuples (#1662)

   expressions, pattern-matching) (#1623)
 - Update name rendering infrastructure in the Lean backend (#1623, #1624)
 - Printers now emit proper diagnostics (PR #1669)
 - Global identifiers are now interned (#1689)
 - Global identifiers are encapsulated properly, and provide easy destructuring as tuple identifiers (#1693)

   on functions, impl definitions. The typeclass resolution in the generated code is left implicit
   (relies on Lean). Limited support for associated types. No support for default implementations.

- Fix a regression affecting projection predicates (#1678)

Change to cargo-hax:
- Improve the caching of rustc when using `cargo hax` commands (#1719)
- Add hidden commands and flags to explicitly manipulate `haxmeta` files (#1722)

Changes to hax-lib:
- New behavior for `hax_lib::include`: it now forces inclusion when in contradiction with `-i` flag.
- hax-lib requires edition 2021 instead of 2024 (#1726)
- Improved `VecDeque` model in F* proof lib (#1728)
- Split the Lean library into several files, update to lean 4.23.0 (#1696)

 - Add end-to-end tests for the website (#1690)
